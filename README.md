<h4 align="center"><samp> Hi there 👋🏾  welcome to my Github! I'm Yasmim, a programming enthusiast and Back-End developer in constant evolution. I'm always challenging myself and looking to leave my comfort zone. I am also curious about news within my area of training and studies. And that's why I'm always looking to read about it. I love working and developing together with people and teams. I love coffee, books, plants, and dogs.
